# Digital Design and RTL Development with Verilog HDL

### Introduction
This repository is a dedicated space for exploring digital logic design and RTL implementation. The goal of this project is to document the process of building hardware-level logic, ranging from fundamental combinational circuits to complex sequential systems. This portfolio serves as a technical log of my progress in mastering hardware description languages (HDL) and the digital design flow.

### Software and Tools
The following industry-standard tools are used for design, simulation, and verification:

* **HDL:** Verilog HDL
* **Design & Synthesis:** Xilinx Vivado (for RTL Analysis and Synthesis)
* **Simulation:** Vivado Logic Simulator for functional verification and timing analysis
* **Hardware Visualization:** Proteus for schematic capture and circuit simulation

---

### Technical Focus
* **RTL Coding:** Writing synthesizable behavioral and structural Verilog modules.
* **Functional Verification:** Developing comprehensive testbenches to validate logic accuracy.
* **Waveform Analysis:** Using timing diagrams to debug and verify hardware behavior.
* **Hardware Mapping:** Analyzing RTL schematics to understand the physical gate-level translation of code.

### Project Goals
* Establish a robust understanding of digital system architecture.
* Build a portfolio of verified RTL modules including ALUs, counters, and Finite State Machines (FSM).
* Prepare for professional opportunities and technical roles in the VLSI and embedded systems domains.
